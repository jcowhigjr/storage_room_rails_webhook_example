== StorageRoom Rails Webhook Example

This Rails application shows how to use the StorageRoom Ruby Gem (https://github.com/thriventures/storage_room_gem) in a Rails application to accept Webhook callbacks from the JSON-based StorageRoom CMS (http://storageroomapp.com).


== Installation

Clone the project and run "bundle install" to install the required dependencies.


== Summary

* Add the StorageRoom Gem to your Gemfile (Gemfile)
* Define your StorageRoom API credentials (config/initializers/storage_room.rb)
* Define your StorageRoom Entry (app/models/article.rb)
* Create a controller that accepts callbacks (app/controllers/storage_room_controller.rb)
* Setup a route to your callback (config/routes.rb)
* Clear the StorageRoom identity map before each request (app/controllers/application_controller.rb)
* Deploy the Rails app to a webserver
* OR: use http://progrium.com/localtunnel/ and run the server locally for testing (run "bundle exec rails server" in one tab and "bundle exec localtunnel 3000" in another one)
* Update the Webhook Definition of the "Article" Collection on StorageRoom with the correct URL, username and password
* Modify an Article on StorageRoom and see your Webhook come alive
